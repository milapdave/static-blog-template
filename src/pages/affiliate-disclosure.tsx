            <h2>Disclaimers for Liimart</h2>
            <p>Liimart is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.in</p>
            
            <p>Since 2020 Liimart has been handpicking only the best selling, most interesting, most desired, and just plain best products on the web.</p>
            
            <p>We do not list products solely for a commission. Our goal is to show the best content possible, and if a product happens to have an affiliate program, we’ll apply it, but it has no impact on our decision making.</p>
            
            <p>Affiliate links do not impact your cost as a consumer in anyway. Your cost to purchase goods is the same regardless of our affiliate links.</p>
